Yesterday, I found a mistake in my research that is really unexpected. I got a deletion line from an F2 population from the crossing of two parents both with the 1RS arm. I checked this line, let us say A, has a deletion, and I wanted to know how big is the deletion, so I tried several rye markers, and they all get deleted. At that time, I just feel the deletion is really big. When I checked the exon capture data yesterday, I found that A's whole 1RS arm might be actually a 1BS arm. It first occurred to me that we might use the wrong line to do exon sequencing. Then when I thought of the many rye deletions in A, it all makes sense that the line might be a real contamination. I could never think of that without looking at the exon capture data and mapped them to 1BS. It is just like from the offsprings of two dogs you find a cat, which you suppose this should not happen. But it happens!
