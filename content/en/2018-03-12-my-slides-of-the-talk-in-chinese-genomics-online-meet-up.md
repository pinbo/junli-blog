Last Wednesday, I was invited to give a talk about wheat genomics by [Chinese Genomics online Meet-up](http://cgmonline.co/). I mainly talked about wheat evolution and domestication, wheat genome plasticity, the importance of reverse genetics in wheat, and ways to increase wheat diversity in breeding. I prepared the slides in English but gave the talk in Chinese, so there are some translation problems during my talk. It is quite often I could not think of the corresponding Chinese translations. I also found my public speaking skill is not good and I need to practice to make my voice and tones fluctuate and full of passion. This talk was shared on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ox_HdMTAQmQ) and slides can be found [here](/slides/wheat_introduction/wheat_introduction.html). Most of the contents are from the review articles from recent years in the last slide. I strongly encourage to read!
