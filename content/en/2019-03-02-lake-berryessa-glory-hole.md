I saw from the News that Glory Hole of Lake Berryessa appears again this year from about Thursday. I remember last time was in the spring of 2017, only two years ago, but it was more than 10 years ago before the last one. I really like the glory hole, so I went there this Saturday. Luckily, the glory hole is still draining water.

Now is the best time in California Central Valley. Everything is green and alive! Really love the green mountains!
