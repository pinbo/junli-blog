On 12/18/2017 and 12/19/2017, UC Davis Plant Breeding Center hosted a plant breeding retreat at the Bodega Bay Marine Lab. Almost all the plant breeders (vegetable, fruits and small grains) working in UCD attended this retreat and shared their work and experiences. We also discussed how to improve plant breeding center to better serve both students and plant breeders. This retreat is the first time to get all the breeders and students altogether. It is a great opportunity for us to socialize and learn from each other. The Bodega Bay is awesome, but we only hiked from the dorm to the lab twice because of the time was too tight. Will visit it another time for sure!
