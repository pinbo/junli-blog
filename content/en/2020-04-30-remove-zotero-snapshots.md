Today I received an email from the department IT office, saying my backup drive has multiple suspected infected files. I found all of them were webpage snapshots taken by Zotero. I never used these snapshots so I disabled this option for the future. I also removed all the old snapshots using the method described [here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/13691/how-can-i-delete-snapshots-and-files). Basic steps: Menu -> Edit -> advanced search -> Attachment File Type -- is -- Web Page -> Create saved search (this will create a folder with the search results) -> Go to the saved search and select all. Note now only snapshots are selected -> right click and move items to trash -> right click the trash icon -> empty.
