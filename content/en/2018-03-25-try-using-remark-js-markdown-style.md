Remark.js for presentation has many easy to use fitures, especially its powerful macros. So I want to use remark.js to convert my markdown to html in blogdown (or Hugo). So made a new template to directly use remark.js to create the final html page.

`![:color green](This should be green color!)` will show ![:color green](This should be green color!)

OR

`I have .red[red color]` will show "I have .red[red color]".

I can also use math formula directly:

`$S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$`
