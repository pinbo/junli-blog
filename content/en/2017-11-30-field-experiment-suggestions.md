I am preparing a manuscript recently. All the phenotype data are from the field experiment. When I was writing the experiment design part, I found I missed several important information. Here is a list to record from my lessons.

- Planting date and harvesting date
- Irrigation type, date and amount
- Pesticide application time, type and amount
- Fertilizer application time, type and amount
- Weather data: precipitation and monthly temperature
- Crop history
- Plot size, number of rows
- Soil type
