This is Junli Zhang, a plant scientist who love crops, especitally wheat. I have been working on wheat for more than 10 years, and want to incorperate a lot of deciplines into wheat study. I love hiking, jogging, and learning! I have learnt a bunch of computer languages, such as R, Python, Perl, SQL and Javascript. I got a lot of pleasure while learning new stuffs and enjoy more when I am using them in my reseach.
