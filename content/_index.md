This is Junli Zhang's blog. Hope this bring you some pleasure and knowledge. Welcome to share your ideas!

I am a plant scientist who love crops, especitally wheat. I love hiking, jogging, and learning! I have learnt a bunch of computer languages, such as R, Python, Perl, SQL and Javascript. I got a lot of pleasure while learning new stuffs and enjoy more when I am using them in my reseach.

I got my Ph.D. on Plant Science from University of Idaho. I am currently an Assistant Project Scientist in Dr. Jorge Dubcovsky's lab in University of California, Davis. I have been working on wheat genetics and breedings for about 10 years. I would like to share my thoughts and experiences with you.
