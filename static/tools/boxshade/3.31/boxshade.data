This file is a Amino-acid similarity file for use with BOX.
Is resembles the GCG  simplify.txt, but similarities contained
in this file are not automatically set-forming. This means:
The line 
I LVM     means that I is similar to L,V and M and also that
                     L,V,M are similar to I.
          It does not imply that L is similar to V or to M.
For achieving this, more lines (the next ones) are necessary.
Although is seems weird, this feature has been chosen DELIBERATELY
because I think it could be helpful in some cases.
Other format requirements are the same as for SIMPLIFY.TXT in the 
GCG-package.

This is a file of default parameters for use with BOXSHADE
there are several sections, one for GENERAL parameters and one for each
output device.
The parameters may be edited freely, they reflect the input expected
from the keyboard if BOXSHADE is run interactively. The purpose of each
parameter is documented briefly within the respective line.

When editing, one has to regard:
- one parameter per line (background/foreground shading = one parameter)
- parameters of a section (labeled :SECTION) start in the first line
  after the label
- there may be no empty (or comment) lines between the parameters of a
  section. These lines are allowed only between sections
- only the leftmost part of every parameter line is looked at. Comments
  are allowed starting at row 10
- don't change the section header

This file is a Amino-acid grouping file for use with NEWBOX.
Each line contains a set of amino acids which are considered
'similar' when calculating the consensus.
This table was taken from ClustalX v1.3b:
WEAK groups:
  These are all the positively scoring groups that occur in
  the Gonnet Pam250 matrix.

This file is a Amino-acid similarity file for use with BOX.
Is resembles the GCG  simplify.txt, but similarities contained
in this file are not automatically set-forming. This means:
The line
I LVM     means that I is similar to L,V and M and also that
		     L,V,M are similar to I.
	  It does not imply that L is similar to V or to M.
For achieving this, more lines (the next ones) are necessary.
Although is seems weird, this feature has been chosen DELIBERATELY
because I think it could be helpful in some cases.
Other format requirements are the same as for SIMPLIFY.TXT in the
GCG-package.

This file is used in colouring residues that are "similar"
to a single consensus residue.
