### Importance of wheat

- The 3rd most important cereals in the world: 713 million tons annually worldwide at 2013

- Provide 20% of calories and proteins in human nutritions

- Grown from Norway and Russia at 65°N to Argentina at 45°S

### Wheat Origin
![](files/wheat_origin.jpg)

### Wheat Classification
#### Based on ploidy
- Common wheat (hexaploid, AABBDD)

- Durum wheat (tetroploid, AABB)

- Einkorn wheat (diploid, AA)

#### By color, hardness and growing season
- color: white vs. red

- hardness: soft vs. hard

- growing season: winter vs. spring

### Wheat domestication

- ~ 10,000 BP: domesticated einkorn in the Karacadag region of southeastern Turkey in the northern Levantine Corridor

- ~ 9,500–9,000 BP: domesticated emmer first appeared in the southern Levant and in southeastern Turkey

- ~ 6,500–7,500 BP: durum wheat was evolved from domesticated emmer wheat

- ~ 8,500 BP: the earliest findings of free-threshing ssp. *aestivum*

White scale bars represent 1 cm. Letters at the lower right corner indicate the genome formula of each type of wheat. Gene symbols: Br, brittle rachis; Tg, tenacious glumes; and Q, square head.

domestication syndrome shared by all domesticated wheats are
increased seed size, reduced number of tillers,
more erect growth, and reduced seed dormancy

### Advantages of hexploid wheat
Compared with tetraploid wheat, hexaploid *T. aestivum* has

- broader adaptability to different photoperiod and vernalization requirements

- improved tolerance to salt, low pH, aluminum, and frost

- better resistance to several pests and diseases

- extended potential to make different food products

---
### Hexaploid wheat genomes

- Big: 17 Gb (5x human, 40x rice, ...)

- Three subgenomes: A, B, D

- Behaves much like a diploid organism during meiosis 

- Genome plasitity: high buffering effect of polyploidy on gene deletions

- Can tolerate aneuploidy: a large number of aneuploids, including
	- a complete set of monosomics
	- a set of 42 compensating nullisomic-tetrasomics
	- a complete set of 42 ditelocentrics, and
	- more than 400 segmental deletion lines

- Polyploidy bottleneck: D-genome diversity is limited

### Wheat genome evolution
- `>` 10-fold genome expansion due to transposable elements (TE)

![](files/wheat_TEs.png)

- Rapid divergence in intergenic regions: in 1 MYA 70% of the intergenic regions are different

![:scale 50%](files/decay_of_synteny.jpg)

???

- Fast change in regions between genes
- Fast rate of gene deletions and changes in gene regulation
- Wheat has a dynamic genome buffered by the redundancy of polyploidy

---
### Gene examples

- Insertions of repetitive elements within regulatory regions of the wheat *VRN1* and *VRN3* vernalization genes, as well as four large independent deletions within the *VRN1* first intron, have been associated with the elimination of the vernalization requirement

- A deletion upstream of the *PPD-D1* photoperiod gene is associated with the widely distributed photoperiod insensitive allele

- Male sterility gene *Ms2* is an orphan gene within the *Triticinae* and expression of *Ms2* in anthers is associated with insertion of a retroelement into the promoter

---
### Sequencecd wheat genomes
- The progenitor of the wheat D genome *Aegilops tauschii* (Luo et al. 2017)

- Wild emmer genome (AABB) (Avni et al. 2017)

- Chinese Spring hexploid wheat genome (AABBDD) (Zimin et al. 2017, no psuedomolecules; IWGSC version has psuedomolecules, but not unpublished yet)

---
### Increase wheat genetic diversity

- Use collection materials

- Introduce genes or genomic fragments from its relatives: 1BL.1RS translocation lines, several rust resistance genes, Xiaoyan series wheat cultivars from Dr. Zhensheng Li

- Synthetic wheat: increase D genome diversity

- Indcued mutations

- Gene editing


---
### Example: USDA NSGC wheat core collection

### *Ph1* locus on 5B

- Control homologous choromsome paring

- Important agronomically: help introduce novel genes into modern cultivars from wheat relatives

![:scale 75%](files/ph1.jpg)

exclude: true
### Important genes in wheat

- Vernalization genes: *Vrn1*

- Photoperiod genes: *Ppd1*

- Reduced height genes: *Rht1*

---
### Importance of reverse genetics in wheat
- Common wheat is a young polyploid with duplicated or triplicated gene copies

- The effects of gene mutations are more frequently masked by redundant gene copies of the other genomes 

- Have to use reverse genetic tools to study some gene functions

---
### Example: *VRN1* vs. *VRN2*

- ***VRN1***: promotes the transition of the apical meristem between the vegetative and reproductive stages.
	- Natural variation in the vernalization requirement for both barley and wheat is frequently associated with deletions or mutations in the regulatory regions
	
- ***VRN2***: acts as a flowering repressor
	- a spring growth habit associated with natural loss-of-function mutations or deletions of the VRN2 gene has been observed so far only in barley and diploid species of wheat

--

- **.blue[Recessive mutations]** are more difficult to select in in the polyploid wheat species than in diploid wheat and barley species

- The selection of .blue[dominant or semidominant] mutations is favored in the polyploid wheat species during domestication and more recent breeding efforts

- Need to combine loss-of-function mutations in multiple homoeologs to reveal the hidden variations

???

The free-threshing Q allele originated from a silent mutation in the microRNA miR172 binding site in the 5A homoeolog that reduces the cleavage of this specific transcript.

only 9 out of 135 rust resistance genes are characterized as recessive

### Wheat TILLING database
- http://www.wheat-tilling.com/

- Tetraploid durum wheat cv 'Kronos' and hexaploid bread wheat cv 'Cadenza'

- Exon-capture sequencing to identify mutations and predict their effects

- 35 mutations per kilobase in tetraploid wheat and 40 mutations per kilobase in hexaploid wheat
