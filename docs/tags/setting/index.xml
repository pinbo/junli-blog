      <description>I have been using Tassel and Haploview for a long time. Usually, I make a new folder under the folders of the two software for each project. However, this means that files in each project are distributed everywhere. Although I have a NOTE file in my project folder to record all the data and analysis locations, I still feel it is better to keep all files and analysis in the same project folder.</description>
